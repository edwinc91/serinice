            I was born in New York. <br/>
            I grew up in New Jersey getting lost in books. <br/>
            I went to school in Boston. <br/>
            I worked some odd jobs afterwards. <br/>
            I found my passion in coding. <br/>
            I developed a particular skill set with General Assembly. <br/>
            I am usually found jamming out on my headphones in search of new songs. <br/>
            I love my life, love my inconsistencies, love my flaws, and love to keep people guessing.

            I am creative. <br/>
            I love coding. <br/>
            I am motivated and inquisitive. <br/>
            I find websites I like and see if I can replicate them. <br/>
            I spend hours looking at websites using Chrome Developer Tools. <br/>
            I am a box of contradictions. <br/>
            I am fierce, yet reserved. <br/>
            Emotional, yet logical. <br/>
            I love the energy and passion of the city, yet appreciate the intimacy of the suburbs. <br/>
            I am a little radical in my politics, <br/>
            a little hypocritical in my actions, and <br/>
            a little dogmatic in my beliefs. <br/>
            I am trying to change the world while trying also to stop it from changing me.

            <p> My name is Edwin Choi and I am interested in joining your team as a Creative Front-End Web Developer.
            I love being in the thick of things when it comes to coding, so I love to go above and beyond
            my job description. Constantly learning as I work with others and looking at their code and learning
            why they coded it this way as opposed to another way helps fuel my passion. I love finding new ways to
            code as well as finding better, more efficient, ways to build cleaner code. </p>
            <p> After graduating from Boston College, I went on to find my passion in coding at General Assembly's
            Web Development Immersive program. My biggest takeaway from General Assembly was the confidence and ability
            to learn fast and apply that knowledge. I have built apps using a plethora of languages, such as HTML, CSS,
            Javascript, Ruby (primarily focusing on Ruby on Rails), NodeJS/Express, jQuery and AngularJS.
            I have experience using ActiveRecord, RESTful APIs and JSON. I also have used PostgreSQL, and MongoDB as databases.
            Having knowledge and experience of these libraries, languages, and databases will help me understand what is going
            on or what needs to be done when collaborating, especially in an environment where it is expected to help
            out where you can during high-pressure times.</p>
            <p>I am always eager to learn and expand my skillset when it comes to coding. I love discovering new technology.
